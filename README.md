# EECS 230 Code Repository

This repository is where we publish code from class. While you can clone
this repo using PyCharm (or of course Git), you should not open it as a
PyCharm project. Rather, each subdirectory is intended to be opened in
PyCharm. You can do this by choosing *Open Project* from the startup
screen or *File > Open...* if you have a file open. Then navigate to and
select the intended directory.
