# Lecture 2: Expressions, Functions, and the Design Recipe

[Lab 1]:
    https://github.com/eecs230/lab1#testing-that-everything-works

This repository includes both lectures notes and code. You are encourage
to follow along by forking it to your own account and then cloning your
fork in PyCharm. Lab 1 includes [instructions][Lab 1] on how to do this,
so you should refer there if you do not remember how. (You can also
clone this repo without forking, but you won't be able to push any
changes you might make.)

Once you have opened the cloned Git repo in PyCharm, you may have to
edit a Python source file and wait a few seconds for PyCharm to
configure your Python environment. When it's settled down, you'll
be ready to move on.

# Python as (fancy) calculator

The first way will learn to use Python is as a calculator. In PyCharm,

a new pane, which contains some information about your Python
installation, followed by the Python console *prompt*:

    >>>

This means that Python is waiting for you to type something for it to
do. One thing you can ask it to do is arithmetic:

    >>> 2 + 3
    5
